# Red Wine Quality Prediction

This project predicts the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties using machine-learning models. By analyzing features such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol percentage, the model learns patterns that contribute to wine quality scores.

## Dataset
The project uses the **Red Wine Quality** dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
Each wine sample includes features such as:
- Fixed acidity  
- Volatile acidity  
- Citric acid  
- Residual sugar  
- Chlorides  
- Free sulfur dioxide  
- Total sulfur dioxide  
- Density  
- pH  
- Sulphates  
- Alcohol  
- Quality (target)

##  Technologies & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy / Pandas  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

##  How to Run

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/red-wine-quality-prediction.git
2. **Install dependencies:**
     pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the script or notebook:**
    python predict.py
   
Model Output
The model predicts a wine quality score (typically 0–10).
You can test new samples or evaluate model accuracy on the provided dataset.
